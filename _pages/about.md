I am a computational neuroscientist (in training) with a passion for NeuroAI. My goal is to derive fundamental mathematical principles of intelligence from computational models of neural systems, paving the way for the next generation of AI development. In parallel, my work in applied machine learning methods for neuroscience has inspired an ongoing interest in using computational techniques (e.g. AI, ABM) to characterize the brain's properties as a complex adaptive system. 

My firm belief is that the divergence between the ways we currently study biological and artificial intelligence is cultural rather than epistemological, and that a unified mathematical understanding of intelligence is not only achievable, but necessary. 

I study Neuroscience and Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge, where I am also a research intern at the [MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit](http://https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/).
