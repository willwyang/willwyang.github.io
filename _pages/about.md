I am a computational neuroscientist (in training) with a passion for NeuroAI. My main goal is to derive fundamental mathematical principles of intelligence from computational models of neural systems to inform the next generation of AI development. In the reverse direction, I am also interested in using AI and complementary modeling approaches (e.g. ABM) to characterize the brain's properties as a complex adaptive system. 

My firm belief is that the divergence between how we study biological and artificial intelligence is cultural rather than epistemological, and that a unified mathematical understanding of the two intelligences is not only achievable, but necessary. 

I currently study Neuroscience and Machine Learning at the [Cambridge University](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/), where I am also a research intern at the [MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit](http://https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/) working on applied ML methods in neuroscience.
