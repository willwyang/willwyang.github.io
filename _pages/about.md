I am a computational neuroscientist (in training) with a passion for NeuroAI. My main goal is to understand the mathematical principles underlying intelligence across artificial and biological systems. My firm belief is that the divergence between how we study artificial and biological intelligence is cultural rather than epistemological, and that a unified mathematical understanding of the two intelligences is not only achievable, but necessary.

I am a student in <b><custom1>Machine Learning</custom1></b> and <b><custom2>Neuroscience</custom2></b> at [Cambridge University](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/) in the [Information Engineering Division](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/academic-divisions/information-engineering).

Currently, I am a research intern in the NeuroAI and Geometric Data Analysis Group at the [Flatiron Institute's Centre for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/neuroai-and-geometry/), where I investigate how the statistics of high-dimensional neural manifold geometry can be used to both interpret and improve DNN generalization dynamics under the supervision of Prof SueYeon Chung and the mentorship of Dr. Chi-Ning Chou.

Previously, I interned with at Imperial College London's [Centre for Complexity Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science) and [Cross Labs](https://www.crosslabs.org/research), where I studied RNN-based models of neural phenomena such as representational drift.
