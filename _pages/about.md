Hi! I'm Will. This page is under construction while I come up with a clever and/or witty bio. 

<!-- I am a computational neuroscientist (in training) with a passion for NeuroAI. My main goal is to understand the mathematical principles underlying intelligence across artificial and biological systems. My firm belief is that the divergence between how we study artificial and biological intelligence is cultural rather than epistemological, and that a unified mathematical understanding of the two intelligences is not only achievable, but necessary.

I am a student in <b><custom1>Machine Learning</custom1></b> and <b><custom2>Neuroscience</custom2></b> at [Cambridge University](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/) in the [Information Engineering Division](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/academic-divisions/information-engineering).

Currently, I am a research intern in the NeuroAI and Geometric Data Analysis Group at the [Flatiron Institute's Centre for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/neuroai-and-geometry/), where I study the manifold geometry of DNN representations under the supervision of [Prof SueYeon Chung](https://www.sychunglab.org/) and mentorship of Dr. Chi-Ning Chou. My research focuses on using the statistics of high-dimensional neural manifold geometry to interpret and improve DNN generalization dynamics in various settings.

Previously, I interned at [Imperial College London's Centre for Complexity Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complexity-science) and [Cross Labs](https://www.crosslabs.org/research), where I studied RNN-based models of neural phenomena such as representational drift. -->
